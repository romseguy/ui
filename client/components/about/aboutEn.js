      <h1>What's the point of Pearrot?</h1>

      <p>Pearrot allows you to contribute easily to the gift economy by sending service offers and demands <strong><em>through
        the places you are connected with</em></strong>.</p>

      <h1>How?</h1>

      <p>Thanks to a Pearrot account, you can contribute:</p>

      <List celled>
        <List.Item>
          <p>
            <TextIcon name="pointing right"/>
            <span style={{color: 'green'}}><strong>By connecting to a place added by someone else.</strong></span>
          </p>
          Once your request is approved by the place's creator or one of its guardians, you can use the place's parrot
          to send a message (every 24 hours) to the people:

          <List bulleted>
            <List.Item>connected to that place ;</List.Item>
            <List.Item>connected to the places belonging to the cities of your choice.</List.Item>
          </List>
        </List.Item>

        <List.Item>
          <p>
            <TextIcon name="pointing right"/>
            <span style={{color: 'green'}}><strong>By adding either a place you own, or a place you know the owner agrees to become a part of the Pearrot network.</strong></span>
          </p>
          Once your request is approved by Pearrot, you can:

          <List bulleted>
            <List.Item>
              Use the place's parrot to send messages (read above) ;
            </List.Item>
            <List.Item>
              Assign roles to people connecting to the place.<br/>
              <Message positive style={{marginBottom: '1rem'}}>
                <TextIcon name="lightbulb"/>Specifically, people who can vote, in other words people who are most active. This role is important because the place's parrot cannot deliver a message until the <strong>unanimity</strong> of voting people is reached ;
              </Message>
            </List.Item>
            <List.Item>
              Accept or reject new connection requests.
            </List.Item>
          </List>
        </List.Item>
      </List>

      <h1>What else?</h1>

      <p>A parrot delivers a message without allowing the recipient to write back. While this is a nice way not to be
        disturbed, you can decide you need an answer by sending a pigeon instead of a parrot!</p>

      <p>Stay tuned for more...</p>
